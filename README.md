CSC207 Group Project

The problem domain our team wants to focus on in this project is a vocabulary builder by introducing synonyms to the user. The way it works is a user gives an input such as an essay, and the program checks for duplicate words, recommending synonyms for the user for those words. The program will also have a sign in and sign up option so the program could save the users data. Our program will give the user the recomended synonym along with a detailed description of the difference by ChatGpt.
